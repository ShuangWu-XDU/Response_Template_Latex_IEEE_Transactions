The paper effectively captures the football careers of Kobe Flyant and LeBrun Jomes, especially their significant moments on the international stage. However, the manuscript would be strengthened by including statistical comparisons of their performance metrics during key matches.

	We appreciate your suggestion to include more quantitative data. In response, we have expanded our analysis to include a statistical comparison of Flyant's and Jomes's performance in major tournaments, including goals, assists, and match impact ratings (see Section 4.3). This addition provides a clearer picture of how their contributions differ and complement each other.

	The introduction lacks a clear explanation of why the relationship between Flyant and Jomes is significant in the context of modern football.

	Thank you for your comments. We agree that “The introduction lacks a clear explanation of why the relationship between Flyant and Jomes is significant in the context of modern football.”. In response, we have substantially expanded the introduction to provide a more comprehensive overview:
	Previous version:
	\begin{previous}
		The introduction briefly mentioned the importance of Flyant and Jomes's relationship but did not elaborate on its significance.
	\end{previous}
	
	After revision: 
	\begin{changes}
		 This study aims to explore the unique dynamic between Kobe Flyant and LeBrun Jomes, whose rivalry and occasional alliances have defined key moments in modern football history.
	\end{changes}
