	The manuscript offers a compelling exploration of the relationship between Kobe Flyant and LeBrun Jomes, highlighting how their rivalry and teamwork have influenced both their careers. The narrative is well-supported by examples from their respective matches. However, the manuscript could benefit from a more detailed analysis of their off-field interactions and how these have affected their on-field performances.

\begin{revmeta}Thank you for your positive feedback on our analysis of Kobe Flyant and LeBrun Jomes. We agree that their off-field interactions are crucial to understanding their on-field dynamics. We have now added a section (see Section 5) that delves into their personal relationship, including interviews and media reports, to provide a more comprehensive view of their collaboration and rivalry.
